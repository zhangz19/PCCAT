# PCCAT
PCCAT (Principle Component and Clustering Analysis Tool) is an add-on module for R designed for Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) clients via Center for Statistical Training and Consulting (CSTAT). It is mainly designed for multivariate environmental data analysis. Based on statistical software R functions and packages, it consists of four main steps: pre-processing, visualization, principle component analysis and clustering analysis. It has been designed to be user-friendly with graphic output and user prompts to take advantage of the many useful functions and packages coded in R, combined with Excel for data analysis.
